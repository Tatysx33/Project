# Project
Hi my name is Tatiana, this is a code using vue.js, JavaScript and HTML.
when user types, it prints a message depending on the grade the student has in the test. 
if grade is more than 70, then the message : congratulations appears in the screen, 
if the number is less than 70 then a message regarding a fail in the course shows.
This code is very important for me as this is the first code using Vue.js that I created.
